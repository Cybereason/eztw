"""
Implementation of EztwSessionIterator, which allows easy iteration over existing session or sessions.
It automatically parses and yields the event contents along with the event records.
If multiple sessions are consumed, a separate thread is used for each of them (since it's blocking).

In addition, provides the convenience function consume_events, which handles the consumption process
end-to-end based on the given EztwEvent objects.

class EztwSessionIterator:
    """
    This class iterates over existing sessions by names - either a single session (current thread) or multiple
    sessions (each in its own thread).

    A second, optional parameter is which events to filter. This can either be None (no filter), or
    a single or a list of EztwEvent objects. Only these events will be parsed and returned.

    Finally, the session iterator automatically counts all events consumed during its operation (including
    filtered ones) and presents a neat summary by provider/event when stopped (including when stopped
    using Ctrl+C, i.e KeyboardInterrupt).

    Example usage:
    >>> session_names = ['session1', 'session2']
    >>> events_to_filter = provider.Event_123
    >>> with EztwSessionIterator(session_names, events_to_filter) as si:
    >>>     for event_record, parsed_event in si:
